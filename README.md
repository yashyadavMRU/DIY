**DroneHub** is a developing e-commerce platform for drone enthusiasts. Currently, the project features a complete Authentication System that allows pilots to register, sign in, and manage their personal "Hangar" (profile).

Current Features:

**Secure Auth:** User registration and login using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

**Pilot Dashboard:** A dedicated user profile section ("The Hangar") to view account details.

**Dynamic UI:** Built with Svelte 5 & SvelteKit for smooth, reactive transitions.

**Backend:** Powered by Node.js & Prisma (PostgreSQL) for reliable data management.
